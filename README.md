# AnimeThemes for Jellyfin

Plugin for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) that fetches anime themes (OPs and EDs)
from [animethemes.moe](https://animethemes.moe). Both audio files and video files are supported.

**An AniDB ID is used to find matching themes, so you'll need to install the AniDB plugin. All other series are ignored.**

## How to use

The plugin creates a new scheduled task that you can configure. By default, it will run every 6 hours.
Also make sure to enable theme music / videos in your display settings.
